## Description

This package can retrieve the version and state of servers running through the Ascoos Web Extended Studio (AWES) suite.

After the package is installed on any Web server, and this address is declared in the AWES settings, it (AWES), periodically sends to this package a JSON file with the status, version and other information of the servers running under the supervision of AWES. 

The package then undertakes to visualize them in a display block, so that the visitor of the page can see them.

The package also provides the ability to display or not the version of each server.
